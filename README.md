# Survey of Distributions

looking at relationships between distributions.

the code for the site can be found [here](https://github.com/robillersomeone/robillersomeone.github.io).

typos are normally distributed, so if you see one please let me know.

## Continuous Distributions
the starting point is the gamma in theory and code in `distributions.py`, due to the point of reference the gamma serves for other distributions.

the graphing code can be found in the viz directory, all graphs are of the probability density function for the given distribution over a subset of their support, normally [0, 20)

### normal distribution
two parameters
- mean (`Œº` location parameter)
- variance (`œÉ^2` scale parameter)


more later on...

### gamma distribution and special cases (Pearson type III)
two parameters
- shape (`k`, positive real numbers)
- scale (`Œ∏`, positive real numbers, `Œ≤` the inverse scale - 'rate' can also be used where `Œ≤=1/Œ∏`)

support : `(0,‚àû)`

known as maximum entropy distribution
for processes with waiting times between events... like the waiting time between poisson distributed events

two constructions
- using exponentials and the gamma function for positive integers:
`Œì(k) = (k ‚àí 1)!`
- using the improper integral from `[0,‚àû)` for complex numbers
    - this is used to build the distributions that follow

### erlang is a case of gamma
two parameters
- shape (`k` positive **integer**)
- rate (`Œª` positive real number, 'scale' - reciprocal of rate (`1/Œª`) can also be used)

support : `[0,‚àû)`

**in relation to gamma** it's the gamma distribution with the shape parameter as an integer

the sum of `k` independent exponentially distributed random variables with mean `Œ∏`
thought of as probability distribution of waiting time until `k-th` arrival.

in relation to chi-squared, it's a chi-squared distribution with 2k degrees of freedom, when `scale=2` ~ generalized chi-squared distribution

the scale parameterization is implemented in `distributions.py` 

<img src="./imgs/erlang_distribution_9_1.png" height="300px" width="400px">

### exponential distribution (Pearson type III)
one parameter
- rate (`Œª` over the interval ``[0,‚àû)``)

support : `[0,‚àû)`

**in relation to gamma**
- as an Erlang distribution with the shape parameter 'fixed' as `k=1`
  - the sum of `k` exponential distributions is an Erlang distribution with `(k,Œª)`
  - by extension, as a gamma distribution
- as the probability distribution of time between events of a poisson distribution
- backwards, `n` independent and identically distributed  exponential distributions random variables  sum to a gamma distribution with shape `n` and rate `Œª`

in relation to discrete distributions it's the continuous case of the geometric

has a memoryless property - past is not helpful in predicting the future.

<img src="./imgs/exponential_distribution_1.png" height="300px" width="400px">

### chi-squared distribution (Pearson type III)
one parameter
- degrees of freedom (`k`, the sum of the squared of independent standard normal distributions)

support : `[0,‚àû)`

**in relation to gamma** chi-squared is a special case of the gamma distribution with `ŒΩ` degrees of freedom, where `gamma(ŒΩ/2 ,2) = œá2(ŒΩ)`

used in hypothesis testing, as goodness of fit and independence.

<img src="./imgs/chi_squared_distribution_3.png" height="300px" width="400px">

### laplace distribution
two parameters
- location (`Œº` real number)
- scale (`b` real number > 0)

support : real numbers (all of 'em)

**in relation to gamma** the laplace distribution is made from the difference of two exponentials (a special case of the erlang distribution, which is a case of the gamma distribution), because of this if we take the absolute value of one laplace distribution we get a chi-square distribution, and a f-distribution if we use two laplaces distributions.

in LASSO regression, is a bayesian regression with a laplace prior.

can be thought of a composite/double distribution

related to the normal distribution
  - normal - is the squared different from the mean
  - laplace - is the absolute difference from the mean

also, check out the laplace transform, which is neat.

from laplace - the frequency of an error is an exponential function of its magnitude without the sign

### beta distribution (Pearson type I)
two parameters
- shape (`ùõº`)
- shape (`Œ≤`)

support : `[0,1]`, so good for probabilities

'distribution over distributions', defining binomial coefficient for continuous variables


**in relation to gamma** is a gamma distribution divided by the sum of that gamma distribution with another, which takes the form `gamma(1) / (gamma(1) + gamma(2))`

 the beta *function* is the product of two iid gamma functions divided by the sum of the two random variables in a gamma function.
 
 the multivariate beta distribution is the dirichlet distribution.
 
 the beta distribution is the conjugate to binomial distribution.

here the beta distribution is symmetric, the alpha and beta parameters are equal positive integers.

f-distribution is also a specific parameterization of the beta prime distribution (inverted beta distribution)

used in f-test in hypothesis testing. null hypothesis ~ two independent normal variances are equal.

in the code, it's built with the gamma function tranforming the sums of the degrees of freedom as well as the individual degrees of freedom - all divided by 2, the f-distribution can be thought of as two the chi-squared parameterizations of the gamma distribution.

<img src="./imgs/f_distributions.png" height="300px" width="400px">

### normal distribution
two parameters
- location (`Œº` mean parameter)
- scale (`œÉ^2` variance parameter)

support : `(-‚àû,‚àû)` real numbers

as the 'shape' parameter increases (for large `k`, or a `k -> ‚àû`) the gamma distribution converges to the normal distribution

**in relation to gamma** using the central limit theorem, the gamma (or any distribution with finite variance) will converge to the normal distribution

- `k` independently distributed gamma distributions, each divided by `V` (the sum of the `k` distributions)


multivariate generalization of beta distribution
can be thought of as 'a distribution over distributions'
  - sampling from a dirichlet results in a distribution

symmetric dirichlet distributions - where all parameters are equal.

  - with value less than 1 the mass is concentrated in a few components.
  - value greater than 1 the mass is dispersed ~ equal in components.

the rayleigh distribution of `œÉ=1` is a chi distribution with `ŒΩ=2`, also the square of a rayleigh distribution is a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom `k=2`.

**in relation to gamma** its the negative log of a uniform distribution raised to the negative `1/ùõº`

if the location of the minimum is 0, then the reciprocal is a weibull distribution

the weibull distribution is also the negative natural log of the uniform distribution raised to 1 divided by the scale, all multiplied by the shape

when `k=2` the weibull distribution is a rayleigh distribution with `œÉ=Œª/‚àö2`

the weibull distribution can be thought of as the failure rate proportional to a power of time `k`
- `k<1` the failure rate decreases over time
- `k=1` constant failure rate
- `k>1`failure rate increases over time

there is also a three parameter weibull distribution, with a location parameter `Œ∏` that is the time before the failure (weibull) process begins
