# Survey of Distributions

Looking at relationships between distributions through code

## Continuous Distributions

### normal distribution
two parameters
- mean (location parameter)
- variance (scale parameter)

### gamma distribution and special cases

#### Erlang is a case of Gamma
two parameters
- shape (positive integer know as `k`)
- rate (positive real number `Î»`, 'scale' - reciprocal of rate can also be used)

##### exponential distribution
can be thought of multiple ways

- as an Erlang distribution with the shape para `k=1`
  - by extension, as a gamma distribution
- as the probability distribution of time between events of a poisson distribution
