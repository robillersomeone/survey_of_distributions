# tests

implement tests for distributions built multiple ways
- from the gamma function
- from the gamma distribution
- from a python library (scipy or numpy) implementation



- gamma
    - function
        - factorial
        - integral
    - distribution  
        - factorial
        - intergral


## TODO

- exponential
    - from gamma
    
- chi squared 
    - from gamma
    - from two (or more) normals

- f distribution
    - gammma function
    - adding multiple gamma functions (chi-squared implementation)
    - a lomax(1,1) distribution is the same as an f(2,2) distribution

- beta
    - gamma/beta function
        - test relationship through implementation

- laplace
    - standard uniform
    - exponential

- normal
    - approximate multiple ways
        - gamma

- t
    - cauchy(0,1) == t(1)
